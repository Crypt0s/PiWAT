==============================================

Misc Notes:
    This isn't tested yet.

Hardware:
    This software package works on RasperryPi Model B 512MB version. It can take some time to start up.  This is known and by design.
    Obstensiby, this could be installed on any Debian ARMv7 HW with >=512MB 

Install Process:
     * Before starting this, make sure your pi is connected to the internet
     * Also make sure you are ready to install and compile for a few hours.

    Step 1:
     Go to the install folder and run the install script.
     The script will download, install, and compile packages for possbily several hours.  This was done in order to provide the best end experience and up-to-date packages without relying on repo managers.

    Step 2:
      Test out the software and make sure everything installed correctly by running the test script in the installer folder

    Step 3 (optional):
      If the test script didn't work, then let @crypt0s know on twitter or file a bug please.


Running The Software:
    Run start.sh found in the root of the install directory
    Follow the instructions found in there.
